# Plan 10.2: GitHub Integration

## Objective
Integrate with GitHub to link code activity to tasks and auto-update task status on PR events.

## Tasks
1. Create GitHub App with required permissions
2. Build installation and repository selection flow
3. Implement PR/commit linking via task ID in branch names
4. Auto-transition task to "in review" on PR open, "done" on merge
