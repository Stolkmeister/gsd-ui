# Plan 1.1: Core Database Tables

## Objective
Create the foundational PostgreSQL tables for users, projects, tasks, and teams. Establish foreign key relationships and basic constraints.

## Tasks
1. Create users table with authentication fields
2. Create projects table linked to owner user
3. Create tasks table with status enum and priority levels
4. Create teams table and team_members junction
5. Create base repository class with connection pooling

## Context
This is the first step in the project. All subsequent features depend on this schema being correct. Using PostgreSQL 16 with native enum types for status and priority fields.
